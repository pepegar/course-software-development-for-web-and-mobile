Today we will:

 

\- See what\'s next for us to learn in web development

Disclaimer
==========

All the following are just pointers in case you\'re interested in
broadening your knowledge in a specific area of web development

Frontend
========

CSS
===

Preprocessors
=============

CSS preprocessors help us keep our CSS code under control by giving us
lots of nice features such as **variables,** **mixins**, etc

 

**- Sass**

**- Less**

Bootstrap
=========

You\'ve already seen bootstrap.  Bootstrap is a frontend library to make
creating websites much easier thanks to all its comoponents

Using & installing JS libraries in your projects with **NPM**

Frameworks
==========

Learn a framework for frontend applications:

 

**- Vue.js**

**- React**

**- Angular**

Tooling
=======

Task runners
============

Task runners will help you keep your project organized.  They\'re used
to run tasks such as: Minify CSS & JS, run tests, compile SASS\...

 

**Gulp.js**

Backend
=======

Deployment
==========

When deploying our web applications there are several options:

 

**- PAAS (Heroku)**

**- Containers (Docker)**

Databases
=========

SQL databases
=============

Learn now to use databases correctly in the backend.

 

**- ORMs**

**- DB Migrations**

No-SQL databases
================

There are times in which we don\'t need a SQL database, so people use
no-sql databases.  They have their pros & cons, but it\'s good to know a
bit about them.  Some examples are:

 

**- Mongo DB**

**- Redis**

For both frontend & backend
===========================

Design patterns

Design patterns are solutions to common problems in software
engineering.  It\'s handy (and sometimes required) to know them.

Github
======

Use github to your benefit.  Lurk around searching for interesting
projects, see how things are built, contribute, showcase your stuff

Continuous integration
======================

Continuous integration is the process of checking that the quality of
your code meets the standards of the project everytime you try to merge
code.

 

**- travis-ci.org**

**- https://circleci.com**

Code interviews
===============

Interview questions
===================

Code interviews are a subject for which people normally prepare a lot. 
If you\'re pursuing a career in software development make sure you spend
some time preparing for coding interviews.
