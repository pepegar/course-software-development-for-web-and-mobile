What do web servers do? Answer HTTP requests with HTTP responses.

We have already seen and used some communication between servers and
clients, using JSON mainly. Today we'll see what other things can a web
server send to the client.

Web servers
===========


``` {.sourceCode .python}
from flask import Flask

app = Flask("name of my app")

app.run()
```

Flask recap
===========

Routes
------

``` {.sourceCode .python}
@app.route("/path/<name>")
def handle(name):
    return "hello {}".format(name)
```

Methods
-------

``` {.sourceCode .python}
@app.route("/tweet/<tweet>", methods = ["POST"])
def handle_tweet(tweet):
    #do fancy stuff with the tweet
    return "whatever"
```

JSON
----

``` {.sourceCode .python}
from flask import Flask, jsonify

@app.route("/tweet/<tweet>", methods = ["POST"])
def handle_tweet(tweet):
    #do fancy stuff with the tweet
    return jsonify([1,2,3,4])
```


A web server can send all kinds of files to the client, such as CSS, JS,
and HTML files.

In Flask, we use the `send_from_directory` function to do this:

serving static files
====================

Why is this useful?
-------------------

Most of the times we will not go to our webpage by opening an HTML file
from our computer. Rather than that, we would go to a internet address
and browse from there. For that to happen, files need to be served from
the server.

Example1
--------

See `staticfiles.py`


HTML forms are the way we have in HTML to gather data from the client to
be sent to the server.

We use the `form` tag to create them:

HTML forms
==========

inputs
------

There are **a lot** of different input types, to name a few: - `radio`:
used to select **one of** between different elements - `checkbox`: used
to make a single value selectable. - `text` - `password`: for masked
text - `submit`: visible as a button that, on click, submits the form

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input\#Form\_%3Cinput%3E\_types


When using Flask, it's very simple to handle the form data sent by the
client. We can import the `request` object from `flask`, and access to
its `form` attribute. It will contain a dictionary with the form data.

Handling HTML forms in Flask
============================


``` {.sourceCode .python}
from flask import request

@app.route("/submit", methods = ["POST"])
def handle_form_submission():
    user = request.form["username"]
    pass = request.form["password"]
    
    return "the login data was: {}:{}".format(user, pass)
```

Example 2
---------

see `usingforms.py`


In the same way Flask can be used to serve files (as we did with HTML
and CSS files previously), it can handle file uploads too!

First of all, let's see how we can gather files from the client to be
sent to the user.

Handling file upload
====================

input type="file"
-----------------

something we need to consided whenever we want to handle files from the
user is adding the multipart encoding to the `<form>` tag:

``` {.sourceCode .html}
<form enctype="multipart/form-data">
</form>
```

when we make our form encoding `multipart/form-data`, we make the
browser allow our `<input type="file">` fields to upload data.

handling file uploads in Flask
------------------------------

In Flask, as with HTML forms, it's very easy to handle file uploads. We
just need to access the `files` attribute from the `request` object and
use it as a dictionary.

``` {.sourceCode .python}
from flask import request

@app.route("/handle-upload", methods = ["POST"])
def handle_file_upload():
    file = request.files["file"]
    
    return "the login data was: {}:{}".format(user, pass)
```

Example 3
---------

see `uploadfiles.py`

whitebelt
---------

Create a Python server that accepts a csv and parse it as a dataframe
using `pandas`. Return its shape after parsing. You'll need to upload
the CSV from a HTML webpage.

Exercises
=========

bluebelt
--------

Create a webpage with an HTML form that gathers:

-   a profile picture
-   a username

And make those profile pictures accesible later on using the
`/profile/<username>.jpg` route.

You'll need to investigate how save the uploaded file to a folder in the
server.
